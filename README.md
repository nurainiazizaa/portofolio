# **Portofolio Projects**
## 1. Climae Hazard Map with Google Earth Engine
Description:

In this project, I created a class and object to make automatic calculations of Fire Weather Index (FWI). I also wrote the script for Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) maps. All the maps are visualized with different colors and we can download maps to our local data. My goal with this implementation was to construct an automatic map that shows vulnerability maps of fire and drought also floods.

## 2. Telco Customer Churn EDA

Description:

In this project, I explored Telco Customer Churn dataset to explore, investigate and learn features and target values. My goal is to know what features have a large correlation to the target value and visualize it.
