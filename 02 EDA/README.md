# **Exploratory Data Analysis Assignment**

Explore data from kaggle about [Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). What we have to do is:

1. Standard Data Cleansing
2. Standard EDA
3. Deep-Dive Exploration

Before we start, we have to import some libraries that can support this analysis.

`import numpy as np`

`import pandas as pd`

`import seaborn as sns`

`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`

Import this if we use google colab and our data is on google drive

`from google.colab import drive`

`drive.mount('/content/drive')`
